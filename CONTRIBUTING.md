# Contributing Guide

## Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Keep changes focused and small.
3. Run relevant tests before opening a PR.
4. Update docs when behavior, schema, or routes change.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Code compiles and tests pass locally.
- New or changed behavior includes test coverage, or a noted testing gap.
- Documentation updated in `docs/` when applicable.
- No unrelated refactors bundled into the same PR.

## Commit Guidance

- Use clear, imperative commit messages.
- Prefer one logical change per commit.
- Reference issue or task IDs when available.

## Security

Do not include secrets in commits. Report security issues privately via the channel listed in `README.md`.
